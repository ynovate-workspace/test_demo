# Project Title: Collaborative Drawing Board (Test Version)

## Overview
This project is a **drawing board application** inspired by tools like **Excalidraw**. It leverages **WebRTC** technology for real-time collaboration. The project is currently undergoing testing and has certain features temporarily disabled for assessment purposes.

### ⚠ Caution:
**NEVER PUSH YOUR CODE** to any repository. Submissions must follow the specified guidelines, or you will fail the assessment.

## Project Goals
This project serves as an assessment for both **Blockchain Skills** and **Full-stack Development Skills**.

### 1. Blockchain Skill Assessment
- **Task**: Deploy an NFT smart contract on the **Ethereum Testnet**.
- **IPFS Integration**: Store NFT images using **NFT.Storage** (or your own implementation for IPFS storage).
- **MINT Feature**: After drawing, clicking the **"MINT"** button should mint the drawing as an **NFT**.

**Requirements**:
- Smart contract deployed on Ethereum Testnet.
- Proper NFT storage configuration using **NFT.Storage** or equivalent.

**Deliverable**:
- Submit the **transaction hash** of the minted NFT token.

### 2. Full-stack Skill Assessment
- **Task**: Fix the collaboration issue for the **drawing board** in public mode.
- **Current State**: The drawing board works in **solo mode** only.
- **Issue**: In public mode, drawings are not shared among multiple users.

**Requirement**:
- Enable real-time drawing updates for multiple users in public mode.

**Deliverable**:
- Submit the **updated code** (Do not push the code; failure to comply will result in disqualification).

## Features
- **Solo Drawing Mode** (Working)
- **NFT Minting** (Temporarily Disabled for Testing)
- **Public Collaboration Mode** (Needs Fixing)

## How to Submit
1. **For Blockchain Task**:
   - Send the **transaction hash** of the minted NFT token.

2. **For Full-stack Task**:
   - Submit the **updated code** via the specified submission method.

⚠ **Remember**: Do not push your code to any repository.
